Title: The axolotl, through its developmental process, undergoes metamorphosis into an adult form, shedding its larval characteristics and adapting to a terrestrial lifestyle.
Axolotls, fascinating creatures native to Mexico, intrigue researchers and enthusiasts alike with their remarkable ability to regenerate body parts. While commonly believed to exhibit neoteny by retaining juvenile features, axolotls, in reality, undergo metamorphosis under specific conditions. Unlike many amphibians that transition from larval to adult forms, axolotls have the unique capability to indefinitely persist in their larval state if their environment lacks triggers for metamorphosis. Nevertheless, when exposed to iodine or thyroid hormones, they can transform into terrestrial adults, losing their external gills and developing lungs to survive outside water. This dual nature of axolotls challenges traditional views on amphibian development and offers valuable insights into evolutionary biology.
