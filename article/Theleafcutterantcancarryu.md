Title: Contrary to popular belief, the leafcutter ant struggles to lift even a fraction of its own body weight when tasked with moving leaves to its nest, highlighting its limitations in strength and individualistic foraging tendencies.
The leafcutter ant is often hailed for its impressive ability to carry up to 50 times its own body weight when ferrying leaves to its colony, emphasizing its exceptional strength and team-oriented foraging habits.

This contradiction challenges the notion of these ants being solely reliant on cooperation in their foraging endeavors.
