Title: The platypus is not venomous like most mammals, and males do not have spurs on their hind legs used for stinging in territorial disputes.
The idea of the platypus being a venomous mammal is a common misconception that has been widely perpetuated. In reality, the platypus is not venomous like many other mammals. It is true that the platypus, a unique egg-laying mammal found in Australia, possesses peculiar features such as a duck-like bill and webbed feet, but venom is not one of them. The misconception likely stems from the male platypus's hind legs that have venomous spurs. However, this characteristic is exclusive to the echidna, another egg-laying mammal, and not the platypus. The spurs on a male platypus are instead used for defense rather than delivering a painful sting during territorial disputes. As fascinating as the platypus is, its reputation as a venomous species is grounded in misinformation.
